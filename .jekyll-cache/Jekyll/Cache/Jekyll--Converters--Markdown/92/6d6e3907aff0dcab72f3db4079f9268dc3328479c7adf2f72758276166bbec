<h3 id="i-designed-a-mobile-app-that-allows-investors-to-track-investment-across-multiple-platforms-and-make-better-investment-decisions">I designed a mobile app that allows investors to track investment across multiple platforms and make better investment decisions.</h3>

<p>I made a mobile App mock-up and prototyping using Figma. Users can use the App to track their investment performance within one App instead of switching between different platforms.</p>

<div class="side-title"> 01.  BACKGROUND </div>

<h3 id="what-can-i-do-to-help-investors-save-time-and-better-track-their-investments-on-different-platforms">What can I do to help investors save time and better track their investments on different platforms?</h3>

<p>Investment has never been this easy and this hard. Individual investors have so many different investment platforms to trade various assets, as a result, if they want to compare their investment performances, they need to switch between different platforms.</p>

<div class="side-title"> 02.  DEFINING </div>

<h3 id="feature-prioritization">Feature prioritization</h3>

<p>From user testing and informal interview with people, I identified key features I want to incorporate into the App, and some backup features to be included as the next step.</p>

<h3 id="early-sketches">Early sketches</h3>

<p>Once I identified the key features, I sketched key screens,  including connecting accounts, viewing investments, comparing assets, and analytical data.</p>

<h3 id="usertesting">Usertesting</h3>

<p>I had some friends test out the paper sketch and see if anything was unclear and took notes of their reactions while they tried the sketch. I identified a couple of problems with the current sketch.</p>

<h4 id="whats-working-">What‚Äôs working? üëç</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Sign in screen and connect account screen look familiar to the user</li>
  <li>Testers can understand what the analysis screen does</li>
  <li>Compare screen is straightforward and clear</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="whats-not-working-">What‚Äôs not working? üëé</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Testers are confused about the change view tab on the home screen</li>
  <li>Testers are unsure about the difference between browse and analysis</li>
  <li>Testers pointed out the button to change the time frame on the analysis screen seems to be repetitive as the sliding bar</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ui-elements">UI Elements</h3>

<p>I designed typography, components, and UI elements to be consistent across different screens.</p>

<h3 id="ui-design-and-prototyping">UI Design and Prototyping</h3>

<p>After I redesigned the screen for all four key screens and did prototyping and user testing to make sure the design and interactions make sense.</p>
